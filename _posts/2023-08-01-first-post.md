# `isEmpty` vs. `count > 0`

In Swift programming, ensuring the efficiency and readability of your code is important. One common task developers often encounter is checking whether a collection, such as an array or a string, is empty or not before proceeding with further operations. Surprisingly, the way you perform this seemingly simple task can have a significant impact on the performance of your code, especially when dealing with large collections. In this article, we'll explore two approaches: using `isEmpty` versus `count > 0`, and shed light on the reasons why one trumps the other.

### With `count > 0`

```swift
if arr.count > 0 {
    // Code for non-empty collection
} else {
    // Code for empty collection
}
```

Some developers uses the `count` property of Swift collections to determine emptiness. This approach seems straightforward â€“ count the elements in the collection and compare the result with zero. However, Its inefficiencies.

When dealing with larger collections, the `count` operation iterates through every element and the time taken increases linearly with the number of elements.



### With `isEmpty`

```swift
if arr.isEmpty {
    // Code for empty collection
} else {
    // Code for non-empty collection
}
```

Instead of counting all elements, `isEmpty` merely checks the presence of the first element. This operation takes constant time, or O(1), regardless of the collection's size and so its efficient.
